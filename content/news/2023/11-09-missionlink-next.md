&nbsp;MissionLink Announces Graduates from 2023 Cohort; Join Esteemed ‘Trusted Innovation Ecosystem’ in NatSec Tech&nbsp;

*Fifty-eight companies graduate from invitation-only program for CXOs of innovative, next-gen companies with dual-use NatSec tech.*&nbsp;

WASHINGTON, DC—November 7, 2023—MissionLink, an exclusive nationwide community that serves as a force-multiplier and gateway to accelerating innovation and advancing solutions to National Security threats, today announced the graduates of its 2023 cohort.&nbsp;

Founded in 2010 by an elite advisory board comprised of the best and brightest minds from the defense, Intelligence and NatSec tech sectors, the Organization’s mission is to connect passionate problem solvers with next-gen, mission-critical capabilities to the right resources, customers, investors, advisors and partners, ultimately solving national security concerns across commercial and federal sectors. For more than 10 years, MissionLink has been on the cutting edge of National Security and is recognized as the organization that has most captured the timeliness and immediacy of the latest security developments, discoveries and breakthroughs.&nbsp;

Jeremy King, MissionLink cofounder and Organizing Board member, commented, “National security’s mission has become much broader and is rapidly evolving, and the need for collaboration between the government and commercial sector is critical now more than ever. For decades, the answer was ‘public-private partnership’ – we believe it is now time to empower industry innovation and facilitate ‘private-public partnership.’ MissionLink has become the most exclusive room in the country to learn, share and contribute to the thought leadership and innovative technologies for what happens *Next.*”&nbsp;

MissionLink’s 2023 cohort was selected by world class technologists and thought leaders, such as Will Grannis, CTO of Google; Tim Newberry, Ten Eleven Ventures and former founder of Blackhorse Solutions; Tim Estes, Authentic Capital and former founder of Digital Reasoning; Bill Crowell, Alsop Louie Ventures and former NSA; Alan Wade, former CIA; and Ron Gula of Gula Tech Adventures and former cofounder of Tenable – bringing together top founders and CXOs from across the US in the areas of cyber, artificial intelligence & machine learning, analytics, biotechnology, autonomy, microelectronics, quantum science, space, UAS/drones, 5G, virtual reality, synthetic environments, internet of things and emerging technologies.&nbsp;

Andy Lustig, MissionLink cofounder and Organizing Board member, also commented: “Our objective is to seed and accelerate innovation across the country, from Washington DC to Silicon Valley and bridge enterprise and national security missions with dual-use commercial capabilities, and the Spring 2022 cohort is certainly representative of the innovation and momentum happening in NatSec tech.”&nbsp;
