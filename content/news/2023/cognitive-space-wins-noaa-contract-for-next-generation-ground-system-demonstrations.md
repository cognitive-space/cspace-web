**Cognitive Space Wins NOAA Contract for Next-Generation <br>Ground System Demonstrations**

*The startup’s automated intelligence constellation management technology helps lower costs and improve mission outcomes for U.S. government use cases.*

**Houston, TX, April 10, 2024** – [Cognitive Space](https://www.cognitivespace.com/) today announced it was awarded a $900K contract with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for Ground Processing Demonstrations under the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA-NOAA-GPD-2023).

This represents Cognitive Space’s first Federal Civil contract. The contract will include the use of Cognitive Space’s flagship AI-driven solution, [CNTIENT-Optimize](https://www.cognitivespace.com/product/), which leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to quickly and intelligently create mission operations plans and schedules across a constellation of satellites.

”We are very much looking forward to working with NOAA as they evaluate how to bring innovative solutions into their next-generation ground systems,” said [Guy de Carufel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guydecarufel/), Founder and CEO of Cognitive Space. “The intelligent automation in CNTIENT-Optimize will streamline operations, improve mission outcomes, and provide an ever-improving capability to the NOAA user base.”

Cognitive Space’s footprint is steadily growing across DoD and Federal Civil programs. In addition to NOAA, the company has completed and ongoing work with multiple government entities, including the U.S. Air Force, the Air Force Research Library (AFRL), the U.S. Space Force, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and the Space Development Agency (SDA). A dual-use technology, Cognitive Space’s CNTIENT-Optimize is commercially available and has reached Technology Readiness Level 9 (TRL), operating on-orbit spacecraft.

The NOAA contract demonstrates the continued viability of CNTIENT-Optimize for U.S. government-sponsored satellite missions.

The Cognitive Space team announced this news during its panel appearance at the Space Foundation’s 39th [Space Symposium](https://www.spacesymposium.org/), which takes place in Colorado Springs, Colorado from April 8-11.

The company completed a 2023 [$4 million seed+ funding round](https://www.cognitivespace.com/news/cognitive-space-raises-4million/) to advance its AI-powered Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform, which is designed to help satellite constellations grow and scale. This funding round helped Cognitive Space accelerate its go-to-market strategy and expand its presence in the rapidly evolving space industry.

Cognitive Space’s AI-SaaS technology offers comprehensive satellite fleet management solutions to government agencies and satellite constellation operators. The company’s mission is to empower these entities to fully harness the space domain for their operational needs.
