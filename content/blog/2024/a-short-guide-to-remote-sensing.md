## What is Remote Sensing?

Remote sensing is the method of measuring an area’s radiation by identifying and monitoring its physical characteristics. It enables us to observe and gather information about the Earth's surface without direct physical contact.

Remote sensing involves the use of sensors mounted on various platforms [such as satellites](https://www.cognitivespace.com/blog/2023/automated-satellite-operations/), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and aircraft to capture data from a distance. This data is then processed, analyzed, and transformed into valuable insights that allow for informed decision-making and a deeper understanding of the Earth's dynamic processes.

The raw data collected through remote sensing contains a wealth of information. For data collected with electro-optical sensors, this information is embedded in the form of pixels, each representing a specific feature on the Earth's surface. Through meticulous processing and analysis, these pixels are transformed into meaningful patterns, unveiling hidden insights. Whether it's monitoring land use changes, assessing environmental health, or tracking the aftermath of a natural disaster, remote sensing enables the identification of subtle patterns that may elude the human eye.

## Active vs Passive Sensors

The two main types of remote sensing are active and passive remote sensing. The process of active remote sensing is conducted via its own light or energy emission source. Passive remote sensing is conducted with reflected light or emissions.

Active sensors act as both a sender and a receiver, emitting pulses to determine the distance to the target and gather information about its properties. Active remote sensors have very few research condition restrictions. For example: Active remote sensing systems can function at any time of day since they don’t rely on sunlight for signal strength. One instance of active remote sensing in action is the [Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar)](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html#:~:text=Lidar%2C%20which%20stands%20for%20Light,variable%20distances&#41;%20to%20the%20Earth.) remote sensing method used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to create shoreline maps, support emergency response operations, and more.

Unlike active remote sensors, passive remote sensors don’t provide energy of their own for research subjects. Passive remote sensors rely on naturally occurring electromagnetic radiation — like sunlight. One example of passive remote sensing is the Landsat mission. Running for over 40 years, the [Landsat mission](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/) is the longest-running Earth observation mission — leveraging passive remote sensing via satellites to monitor and collect data on Earth’s changing climate, land use, and environments.

## Remote Sensing Technology, Devices, and Instruments

Various technologies empower scientists, researchers, and decision-makers to explore the intricacies of our planet. These tools function as essential sensors, capturing the complex dynamics of the Earth. There are many types of devices and instruments used for remote sensing, but some of the most commonly known are:

                  <p><strong>RADAR Sensing:</strong> Radar is an active remote sensing method that emits energy flow to reach a subject. Based on the energy’s travel time to and from the sensor (radar), the sensor can measure the subject’s distance. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on satellites enables all-weather imaging, ideal for applications like terrain mapping, disaster monitoring, and detecting subtle surface deformations.</p>

                  <p><strong>LIDAR: </strong>Lidar, an acronym of "light detection and ranging" is an active remote sensing method that uses light impulses to identify a subject’s location and distance. It operates by emitting laser pulses toward the Earth's surface and measuring the time it takes for the light to return after hitting an object. By collecting these return signals, Lidar constructs highly accurate and detailed elevation models, capturing the vertical dimension of the terrain.</p>

## The Process of Remote Sensing

The process of remote sensing consists of seven stages: energy source, radiation and atmosphere, interaction with subject, recording of energy, transmission, reception, and processing, interpretation and analysis, and application.

1. **Energy source**

   Secure a form of energy that can provide electromagnetic energy for the subject of study (Examples: Sunlight, or a RADAR or LIDAR energy source).

   &nbsp;

2. **Radiation and atmosphere**

   While the energy flows from its source to the subject, it will interact with the atmosphere it’s passing through.

   &nbsp;

3. **Interaction with target**

   As the energy travels and connects with the subject, the way the subject interacts with the energy relies on the features of both the subject and the radiation.

   &nbsp;

4. **Recording of energy**

   Once the energy is emitted by the subject, the remote sensor collects and records the electromagnetic radiation.

   &nbsp;

5. **Transmission, reception, and processing**

   After the radiation is logged via the remote sensor, the electromagnetic radiation must be dispatched to a location for analysis and image interpretation.

   &nbsp;

6. **Interpretation and analysis**

   The image created from the electromagnetic radiation is analyzed to gather information and data on the subject.

   &nbsp;

7. **Application**

   Once the information and data are gathered from the image, we can better study the subject to gain new insights and predictions to resolve potential issues.
